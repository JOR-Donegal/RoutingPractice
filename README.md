# Introduction

Before beginning these exercises, ensure you have understood my notes on [Routing Theory](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/routingtheory).

In these notes, I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in network infrastructure requirements and practices as an applied discipline.

This particular collection deals with practical exercises and skills. I am carrying out these exercises on GNS3 2.2.42 running under Ubuntu 22.04LTS. These exercises will work on many other platforms, if you run into issues, adapt!
