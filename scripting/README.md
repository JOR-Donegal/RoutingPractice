# Scripting

We need to know how to exercise our scripting skills in GNS3. In these exercises, I am going to show you how to do some basic scripting, how to configure GNS3.

You have previously completed my exercises on [Ethernet Practice](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/ethernetpractice).

In GNS3, I opened the previous _CDPTest_ project and saved it as _Scripting_.&#x20;

I started all the appliances.
