# LAN Routing

In a previous exercises, we examined a range of topics in switching.&#x20;

In this set of exercises, we need to build on that knowledge and create a simple routed network using switches. This is where things get a bit complicated!

In a modern LAN, we use L2/L3 switches for routing. We need to make sure whatever images we use are actually L2/L3. In the labs at ATU Letterkenny, we have both L2 and L2/L3 switches. Select carefully which you use.&#x20;

Most courses in networking will spend a vast amount of time on dynamic routing, and we will look at that in a later section of the course. The reality is that most enterprise networks on a single campus site will use static routing with switches. In this sequence of exercises, that is the skill we intend to achieve.
