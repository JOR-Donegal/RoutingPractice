I will use subnets 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24, also VPCS 3 and 4 as shown. Which routers you link to which interface is not important but tabulate it! For simplicity, I use a /24 for every link. I a real design, Iâ€™d use a /30.

I configure as shown.

```
hostname Router1

int gi0/0
 description LAN
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shut
 exit

int gi0/1

 description Router4
 ip address 192.168.103.1 255.255.255.0

```

 no shut
 exit

```

Each router should be able to ping three remote routers, test that this is the case.

Also configure the four VPCS. For VPCS1

```
ip 192.168.1.101/24 gateway 192.168.1.1
```

For VPCS2

```
ip 192.168.2.101/24 gateway 192.168.2.2
```

For VPCS3

```
ip 192.168.3.101/24 gateway 192.168.3.3
```

For VPCS4

```
ip 192.168.4.101/24 gateway 192.168.4.4
```
