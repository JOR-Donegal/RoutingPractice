# Router-on-a-stick

On a modern network we tend to use a L2/L3 switch for campus routing, however there are cases where we use actual routers. One example would be at a small branch office where the router may be used for LAN routing as well as WAN connectivity. Router ports are expensive so as long as it is not a bottleneck, could we use a single router port, trunked, to route all our VLANs?

This is a router-on-a-stick!
