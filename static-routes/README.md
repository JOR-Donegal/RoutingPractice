# Static Routes

The simplest way we can define routing on a network is to use static routes.

In the LAN examples we looked at previously, we had a single L2/L3 switch or a single router. These devices know how to find every network because they all connect directly. Whenever we have more than one routing device, every device needs to know how to find every network. In this practical sequence we will examine how to do this using static routes.

If you are building an SME/ME WAN network, you need to test the routers in your lab before deploying them to the field offices.
