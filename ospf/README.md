# OSPF

In the LAN examples we looked at previously, we had a single L2/L3 switch or a single router. These devices know how to find every network because they all connect directly. Whenever we have more than one routing device, every device needs to know how to find every network. In this practical sequence we will examine how to do this using static routes. We looked at the simplest routing protocol commonly used, RIPv2. We rarely use RIP these days except on the smallest networks.

In this session we will look at the protocol we most commonly use in enterprise and small data centres, OSPF.
